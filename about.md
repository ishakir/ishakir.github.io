Welcome to my blogging site, courtesy of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).

This is a place for me to vent various ramblings on the software world and anything else that catches my attention. I hope you may find some of the content interesting.

This site is not intended to be used as a CV, you can find that [here](http://registry.jsonresume.org/ishakir). If you're interested in any Open Source work I've done, you can find that on my [Github profile](https://github.com/ishakir). Also feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ImranShakir17) or [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/imran-shakir/73/209/bb6).
